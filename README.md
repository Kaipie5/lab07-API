## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application is a city explorer app. It allows a user to explore weather, locations, and events throughout a given city. I am building it to allow a user to quickly and easily view information about a city that they are interested in exploring.

## Getting Started

I am using Node, npm, and express. As well as Javascript, API's and eventually SQL
